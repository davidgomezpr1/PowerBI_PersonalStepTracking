## Motivation

As a health and fitness enthusiast, I strive to walk at least 10,000 
steps everyday , to ensure I stay active.

## Overview

- Structuring of the [data](https://github.com/davidgomezpr1/PowerBI_PersonalStepTracking/blob/Portfolio_Projects/StepTrackingNov21.xlsx) into a Fact(`FACT_Activity`) and Dimension Tables(`DIM_Date` & `DIM_Activity`).
- Step tracking for November 2021, using my activity tracking device. Considered the main two activities (Walking and Hiking). Please note that I only go on hikes on Sundays, due to lack of time during the week.
- Cleaning of data, leveraging the `Power Query Editor`. Creation of table relationships to ensure appropriate data analysis.
- Leveraging `DAX` to calculate the total steps and average steps taken.
- Creation of a dashboard with a breakdown of steps by activity, steps by week of the year and weekday.
- Creation of an alternative dashboard, to showcase the statistics by percentages as well as the amount of calories burned. An estimate of 0.045 calories/step was taken, regardless of the activity [[1]](https://www.livestrong.com/article/238020-how-to-convert-pedometer-steps-to-calories/).

## Conclusions

- The analysis concluded that I attained my goal of walking at least 10,000 steps daily, with an average of 11,065 steps walked. This indicates that I have built a habit of consistently walking and that I am on track to hit the same numbers in the months to follow.
- As anticipated, the steps from hiking only account for 14% of the total steps taken. This is due to the fact that I only go on hikes once a week. Should I wished to increase those numbers up, I would have to make more time to go on hikes, or look for closer spots to reduce travel time, thus reducing the time required for said activity. 
- On average, I tend to walk more on Mondays, with an average of almost 12,500 steps. This may be due to more time available as I tend to have less workload earlier in the week.
- October, 30 was the day I burned the most calories, 747 cal. This was the result of the longest walk I had taken yet, 18,675 steps.
